# The Beginning: Building, Breaking, and Learning in Code

If you’re reading this, welcome! 👋  
This is the first post on my new developer blog — a place where I’ll share my journey of **building real projects**, **breaking things often**, and **learning a little more each time**.

For me, code was never just about syntax or output.  
It’s about *curiosity* — asking how something works, and then asking how it could work better.

## 🌱 Why I Started Writing

I’ve always enjoyed building — from simple HTML pages to complex full-stack systems like **SplitEx** and **WealthNest**.  
But somewhere along the way, I realized I was learning *so much more* than what the code alone showed.

Each project brought lessons that didn’t fit into GitHub commits:

- 💡 How design decisions affect collaboration.  
- 💡 How debugging shapes patience and creativity.  
- 💡 How each failure can turn into the start of a new idea.

This blog is where I want to capture those moments — not just as notes, but as stories worth sharing.

## ⚙️ The Real Learning Curve

If you’ve ever learned to code, you probably imagined it like this:

> Step 2: Apply it perfectly  
> Step 3: Build amazing things  

But in reality, it’s a cycle — not a straight line 👇

<Mermaid
  className="mermaid-diagram my-4"
  chart={`flowchart TD
    A[Write new code] --> B{It works?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Celebrate briefly]
    B -- No --> D[Debug for hours]
    D --> E[Test again]
    E --> B
    C --> F[Find next problem... and start over]
  `}
/>

🔍 My Philosophy: Build, Break, Rebuild

Whenever I take on a new concept or project, I follow my personal Rule of Three:
	1.	Build it once — just to make it work.
	2.	Break it intentionally — to understand why it fails.
	3.	Rebuild it cleanly — to make it efficient and reliable.

That’s how I’ve learned the most — by exploring both success and failure.

When I was developing SplitEx, this mindset was tested again and again:
	•	Broken authentication:
I misconfigured redirect URLs and ignored session expiry. Users were randomly logged out, and it pushed me to finally understand JWTs, refresh tokens, and middleware validation properly.
	•	Database disaster:
I once ran a DROP command on the wrong schema — deleting every user record.
Painful, but it taught me the importance of versioned backups, safe migrations, and schema design that’s easy to recover.
	•	Frontend bugs:
An infinite render loop in React made me dive deep into state management and the lifecycle of re-renders.
What started as a bug became a breakthrough in how I structure components now.

Each of these “breaks” hurt a little — but each one deepened my understanding.
They didn’t just teach me how to fix problems; they taught me how to think like a systems designer.

🧩 What I’ll Be Sharing Here

In this blog, you’ll find short, honest reflections on:
	•	🖥️ The technical — full-stack lessons, cloud tips, analytics dashboards.
	•	🎨 The creative — UI design choices that make apps easier to use.
	•	🤝 The personal — teamwork, hackathons, leadership, and motivation.

My goal isn’t to teach — it’s to share the real process of learning in tech: the messy, unpredictable, and rewarding kind.

☕ Final Thoughts

If you’ve ever stared at your screen wondering why nothing works, you’re not alone.
Every bug fixed, every refactor, every small success — it all adds up to something bigger.

As developers, we don’t just build software.
We build our patience, clarity, and resilience — one bug at a time.

This blog is my space to document that journey, honestly and openly.
Thanks for being here at the start of it.

See you in the next post 👋
