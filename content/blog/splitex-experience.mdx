# Building SplitEx: Turning Everyday Payments into a Smarter System

When we started developing **SplitEx**, my goal wasn’t just to build another expense-sharing app — it was to *fix what existing ones missed*.  

Most of us have used tools like Splitwise to settle group bills or trips, but I noticed real gaps:  
❌ No way to **verify** who added an expense.  
❌ No **UPI** integration for instant settlement in India.  
❌ No clear system of **admin roles** or leadership handover in groups.  

SplitEx became my solution — a smarter, more secure, and locally relevant version of expense management.

## 🧩 My Role in SplitEx

I led the **entire development cycle**, from the first wireframe to the deployed web app.  
This included:  

- Designing the UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a clean, simple experience.  
- Connecting the app to **Supabase** for cloud authentication and PostgreSQL storage.  
- Implementing a **verification workflow** so every expense required at least one member’s approval before settlement.  
- Integrating **QRServer API** to dynamically generate UPI QR codes for quick payments.  
- Creating **real-time dashboards** with Chart.js and **PDF exports** using jsPDF.  

But more importantly, I learned how small design choices can completely change **trust and transparency** in a group system.

## ⚙️ What Made SplitEx Different

Here’s what set SplitEx apart technically and conceptually:

| Feature | Problem It Solves | Implementation |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Expense Verification** | Prevents false or accidental entries | Locked “Settle” button until verification by another user |
| **UPI QR Integration** | Instant, localized settlements | Dynamic QRServer API calls linked to user UPI IDs |
| **Auto Admin Transfer** | Prevents orphaned groups | Automatic reassignment when an admin leaves |
| **PDF Reports** | Record-keeping and reimbursement | jsPDF-generated summaries and analytics exports |
| **Real-time Cloud Sync** | Ensures group data consistency | Supabase Realtime and PostgreSQL backend |

Each of these was not just a feature — it was a deliberate response to a *real user frustration* I’d personally seen in existing systems.

## 🔄 Verification & Settlement Flow

Here’s a simplified version of how SplitEx ensures secure, verified transactions:

import Mermaid from "@/components/Mermaid";

<Mermaid
  code={`flowchart TD
A[User adds expense] --> B{Verified by another member?}
B -- No --> C[Expense locked]
B -- Yes --> D[Settlement enabled]
D --> E[Generate UPI QR for payee]
E --> F[Payment complete]
F --> G[Update analytics + logs]
C -->|Await approval| B
`}
/>

This flow ensures no payment happens without group consensus — something even major apps often overlook.

## 📊 Lessons Learned


Designing for Trust:
I realized users care less about how pretty an app looks — and more about whether they can trust it. Adding verification gave users confidence that no one could fake expenses.
Thinking in Systems:
Supabase taught me the power of backend-as-a-service tools. With Auth, Realtime DB, and cloud security built-in, I could focus on workflow design instead of server maintenance.
Balancing UI and Logic:
It was tempting to over-engineer the interface. But the biggest wins came from simplifying — one clean button at a time.
Debugging Under Pressure:
From QR code generation bugs to database conflicts, I learned how to isolate problems quickly.
(Hint: Console logs + clear modular naming = lifesaver.)



💬 Behind the Scenes


Developing SplitEx wasn’t a straight sprint.
At one point, the QR system kept breaking because UPI strings weren’t escaping properly. Another time, two users verifying at the same moment caused duplicate DB entries.

Instead of seeing them as blockers, I learned to treat every bug as a case study in cause and effect.
Each fix made the system — and me — better.



🌟 What’s Next


If I ever expand SplitEx beyond the academic phase, I’d love to:

Build mobile apps (Flutter for Android & iOS).
Add recurring expenses for subscriptions/rent.
Include smart analytics — monthly budgets, predictions, spending patterns.
Introduce multi-currency and international groups.


The foundation is solid — now it’s about scaling the idea responsibly.



🚀 Final Thoughts


SplitEx reminded me that innovation doesn’t always mean inventing something new — sometimes it means doing existing things better.
The expense verification and UPI integration turned what could’ve been “just another project” into something real, practical, and proudly mine.

If there’s one thing I learned, it’s this:

Every problem you solve for yourself has the potential to solve it for thousands of others.
